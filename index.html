    <p>welcome to my landing page with a bit of information
      about who i am and some of my current interests and hobbies.
      I have no prior experience in coding and that is why I decided to
      join <strong>Moringa school</strong> specifically the prep course. I would like
      to gain skills on programming and hopefully launch a career in software
      developement.</p><br><br>
