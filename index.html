      <p>welcome to my landing page with a bit of information
       about who i am and some of my current interests and hobbies.
       I have no prior experience in coding and that is why I decided to
       join <strong>Moringa school</strong> specifically the prep course. I would like
       to gain skills on programming and hopefully launch a career in software
       developement.</p><br><br>

        <h2>WHAT I HAVE LEARNT AT MORINGA SO FAR</h2>
        <p>some of the things that I have been able to learn in the past few weeks at Moringa school
        is how to use the terminal in a linux system and how to navigate using the command line. I have also
        gained some skills in creating a simple web page using html and a bit of css to style the page.</p>
      <h2>INTERESTS AND HOBBIES</h2>
        <p>apart from coding, Astronomy is a field that really fascinates me.
        <em>Are we alone in the universe?</em>
        is a question that I always love to explore and find out what other
        scholars and scientiests think about it.</p>
        <p>my hobbies include
          <ul>
            <li>football (an avid Chelsea fc fan)</li>
            <li>travelling</li>
            <li>playing pool</li>
         </ul>
      These activites help relax and re-energize my brain</p>
